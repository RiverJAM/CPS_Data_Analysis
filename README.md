## Findings

### Charter v Neighborhood Public

Do Charter Schools perform differently than Neighborhood Public schools on average? Our outcome metrics to gauge school performance were graduation rates, test scores, and college admissions.

##### Do Charter Schools differ from Neighborhood Public Schools in their Graduation rates?

H<sub>O</sub>: Mu<sub>1</sub> - Mu<sub>2</sub> = 0

H<sub>A</sub>: mu<sub>1</sub> - mu<sub>2</sub> != 0

We reject the null hypothesis. The data show that charter schools have higher 4 and 5 year graduation rates. Additionally, Neighborhood schools have a greater range of graduation rates.
